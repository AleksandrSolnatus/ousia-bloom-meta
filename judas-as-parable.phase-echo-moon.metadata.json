  "description": "A theological reflection using Judas to probe betrayal, fate vs. freedom, and the alchemy of grace. From Jesus’ 'friend' in Gethsemane to the thirty coins and Judas’s remorse, the essay argues that even the worst act can be transmuted toward light without excusing the sinner. It considers Borges’s Judas, the necessity of the Passion, and repentance as the true lesson.",
