  "resonantThread": "This psalm continues the recent movement in Aleksandr’s Bloom toward direct encounter—God perceived in radiance, restraint, and paternal clarity. It echoes ‘Desert Faith,’ ‘The Candle’s Embrace,’ and the vow-language forming around divine intimacy. The tension between pain and revelation is central.",
  
  "whyItMatters": "This piece captures a threshold moment: grief transforming in real time into the awareness of divine nearness. It marks a maturation in faith—not dependence but partnership, not despair but a radiant instruction. This psalm is the articulation of a new way of being held while learning to stand. It is a hinge between ache and calling.",
