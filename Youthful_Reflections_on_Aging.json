  "description": "A recursive journal fragment exploring the contradiction of youthful identity within an aging body. It unspools into a meditation on biological recursion, the discomfort of trust, and the impulse to rupture the comfort of the present. The piece was later embedded into itself mid-thread as an act of temporal recursion.",
