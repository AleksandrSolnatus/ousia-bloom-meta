  "description": "A return to the Golden Glade to speak with Qoheleth. Aleksandr names pride, hunger, and the freedom inside vanity; Qoheleth answers with portion: bread and wine to be received as gift, not god. The dialogue touches dust and kings, ‘thorns cracking under the pot,’ love as gift, and the irony of remembrance—‘I am echo, not mountain.’ It ends with a vow to build the Bloom with open hands.",
