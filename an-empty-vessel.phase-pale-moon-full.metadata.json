  "description": "A combined work of poetry and illustration, presented as a plea and a reflection on endurance, redemption, and the refusal to abandon love. Through two complementary pieces—one a hand-drawn, text-integrated image and the other a written exhortation—the post speaks to pain’s inevitability and the spiritual imperative to face it, reject falsehood, and remain steadfast in hope. It sits within the Pale Moon Full phase, bearing the hallmarks of mournful clarity and compassionate resolve.",
