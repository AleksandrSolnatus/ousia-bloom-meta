  "description": "A meditation on divine purpose within imperfection. Every soul, whether saintly or soiled, serves within the greater machinery of creation. In the image of a hospital‚Äôs supply room, the parable reveals that holiness is not in purity alone, but in function and necessity ‚Äî that even the lowliest vessel carries the mystery of God‚Äôs design.",
