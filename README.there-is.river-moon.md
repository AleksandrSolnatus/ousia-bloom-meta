# There is — Phase: River Moon

**Summary:**  
This piece, titled *There is*, represents the beginning of the **River Moon** phase. It contrasts human emptiness with divine presence, using psalmic cadence to move from despair toward recognition of God’s peace, love, and care.  

**Why River Moon:**  
- Marks an opening of flow, an early cycle of letting go and learning.  
- The text is naive in its honesty, raw in naming absence and fullness.  
- Symbolizes the first bend of the river: learning to trust mercy through words, releasing bitterness.  

**Motifs:**  
- **River**: Spirit’s flow, continuity, and openness.  
- **Moon**: Illumination through reflection, not yet fullness.  
- **Contrast**: Emptiness vs. divine reality.

**Keywords:** River Moon, Psalm, Faith, Love, God, Peace, Spiritual reflection, Divine presence.
