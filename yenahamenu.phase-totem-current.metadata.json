  "whyItMatters": "This piece bridges scripture and subconscious form. 'Yenahamenu' recalls the promise tied to Noah—that he would bring relief. The Hebrew root נָחַם (nacham) means 'to comfort, console, bring relief,' anchoring the word in covenantal hope. The drawing embodies this promise through flowing currents, protective outlines, and vibrant color-field. It belongs to Totem Current: archetypes rising raw from depth.",
