  "description": "A meditative parable exploring faith as an act of endurance rather than arrival. A traveler, weary from distance, carries a single seed through barren lands. When he plants it and leaves, he realizes the seed was never his to see bloom — his purpose was to carry it faithfully to the soil.",
