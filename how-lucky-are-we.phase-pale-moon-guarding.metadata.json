Through brief yet potent lines, the piece honors endurance through trials, the quiet victory of awakening, and the clarity that what matters is existence itself. Accompanied by an abstract artwork blending flowing forms, vibrant colors, and a central cross, the post weaves together faith, perseverance, and the beauty of continuing on.",
