  "description": "Original parable: a people guided by three simple rules are tempted by a scorpion bearing flame, jewel, and spear—power, beauty, and force. Hoarding, sickness, and fear spread until a messenger offers a different way: ‘Accept my love.’ Acts of generosity reappear—a child’s bread, a woman lifting a neighbor’s burden, a man sowing seed—and the narrow path is revealed: life in Him as the light of man.",
