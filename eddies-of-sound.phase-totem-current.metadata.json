  "description": "A synesthetic totem: a bird-form emerges from red–yellow–blue ribbons that spiral like pressure waves. Feathered graphite wing contrasts the saturated field; a collar of small triangles and watchful motifs crowns the head. The piece maps how sound swirls (eddies) and lifts—voice carried on wing (phōnē epi pterou).",
