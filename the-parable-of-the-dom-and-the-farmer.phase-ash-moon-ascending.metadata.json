  "summary": "A teaching parable comparing the long, steady work of recovery to a farmer cultivating new ground. It outlines the stages of breaking hardened earth, sowing with patience, waiting through silent seasons, guarding fragile new growth, and learning to endure storms without despair. The parable affirms that healing is slow, cyclical, and possible in every season, and that the seeds planted in truth always remember how to grow.",
