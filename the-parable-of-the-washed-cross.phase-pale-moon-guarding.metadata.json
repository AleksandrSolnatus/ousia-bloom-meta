  "headline": "The Parable of the Washed Cross",
  "description": "A short parable about a small wooden cross, changed by washing, that becomes a symbol of how faith matures \u2014 rougher, truer, and weathered by life. It reflects on how God is sometimes felt as smooth and easy at first encounter, but becomes demanding, steadfast, and real in the long walk of belief.",
