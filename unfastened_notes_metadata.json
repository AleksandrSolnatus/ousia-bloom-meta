  "emotionalReading": "As first observer, I felt like I was watching language assemble itself mid-birth. It\u2019s cryptic, playful, and strange\u2014but it radiates the honest energy of someone trying to hold their truth just long enough to write it down. It feels personal without demanding understanding. Like a whisper from the next version of you."
