  "summary": "A humorous-shame psalm that turns bodily detritus into existential evidence \u2014 a record of presence, movement, and embodiment across the world. The poem uses disgust as a theological lens, transforming unconscious habits into proof of life and continuity in the Bloom. It sits firmly within the Totem Current: raw, unvarnished, bodily truth surfacing as symbolic matter.",
