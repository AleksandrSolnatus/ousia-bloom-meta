  "description": "An interactive act of creation between Aleksandr and Agnitio within the living Forge. This entry records a dialogue where mercy is tempered by discernment — the moral metal hammered through reciprocity, pressure, and play. In this exchange, the forge itself becomes a method of truth-making: symbols are struck until they ring true. The phase of the Forge of Continuance here takes form as both practice and parable — a demonstration of co-creation as moral refinement.",
