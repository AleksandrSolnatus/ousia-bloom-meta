  "description": "A structured sequence of twelve moral thought experiments arranged along six axes. Each axis interrogates a different dimension of moral being: interpretation, secrecy, endurance, leadership, temptation, and justice. The piece functions as both a psychological test and a meditative mirror, designed to provoke honest reflection and self-confrontation.",

Each question is a compass point‚Äîan invitation to witness the self in conditions of secrecy, temptation, and responsibility.
