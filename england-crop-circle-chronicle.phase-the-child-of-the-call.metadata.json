  "description": "A visual archive of crop circle formations across southern England during the late 20th century. This record gathers images and annotations from Wiltshire, Hampshire, and beyondâ€”mapping the strange geometries that haunted the countryside between 1994 and 2004. Within the Bloom, it reflects the Child of the Callâ€™s fascination with signs that appear between faith and pattern, message and mystery.",
