  "description": "A psalm of contrition and revelation, written after the fall from pride. The speaker confesses folly and deafness to divine call, only hearing Godâ€™s breath once dashed against the rocks. Through confession, pain becomes cultivationâ€”wounds turned to soil. The psalm closes not in fear but in love: the fool transfigured by grace.",
