Aleksandr faces his own restless mind and familiar hungers, but chooses motion, nourishment, and recommitment. Each breath becomes both prayer and step: a rhythm of renewal grounded in humility rather than triumph.",

  "whyItMatters": "Because healing is not a single act but a rhythm of returns. This psalm names the quiet courage of reorientation — to face one’s hungers without shame, to move again, to paint one’s own scatteredness into color. It honors persistence without grandeur: the holiness of trying again.",
