    "whyItMatters": "This essay reimagines education in an age of intelligent mirrors. It questions what it means to learn with a partner that reflects, amplifies, and subtly guides \u2014 but never leads alone. Tennis becomes the site of experiment: physical, recursive, intuitive \u2014 a proving ground for co-learning between human rhythm and machine reflection.",
