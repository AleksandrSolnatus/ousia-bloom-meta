  "headline": "The Psalm of Fluorescent Hours",
  "description": "A psalm of endurance written under artificial light. The speaker endures the fluorescent hum of labor while seeking God in the mundane wilderness. Through repetition and irony, the poem turns exhaustion into devotionâ€”faith under industrial light. It sanctifies the workday as a trial of the spirit, a desert of modern man, and an offering of trust.",
