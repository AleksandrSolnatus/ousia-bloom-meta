The Game (You Lose). And?
How do you win the unwinnable game?
ALEKSANDR

I was lying on my back on a cool California night when it happened.

I lost.

Out of nowhere, seemingly. Something someone said around me triggered a memory, and just like that—I lost the game.

It had been years since I last thought about it. I didn’t even know I was still playing. But it didn’t matter. By thinking of the game, I had lost. Even if you do not want to play, in some capacity, you do. It exists beyond willpower.

Maybe you could argue that if everyone decided not to play, the game would cease to be. But really, could it ever be stopped? Trying to destroy the game might entrench it further. After all, the game perpetuates itself by making "not thinking about it" the win state. What reinforces that more than mass denial?

So how does one win an unwinnable game?

By altering the objectives.

In Monopoly, you could stop caring about properties and instead make it your goal to hoard one-dollar bills. This creates a new, albeit small, form of leverage controlling a resource the other players didn’t even realize they relied on. More germane to this, though, is ensuring your goal is both winnable and influential.

And that is what I did. I decided I was no longer playing by the traditional rules.

But simply inverting the rules thinking about the game to "win" didn’t work. That only made the relationship between me and the game more adversarial. It wasn’t a new game; it was the same game, now forcing me to dwell on it even more.

So I took it a step further.

What if the game was something else entirely? Not a trap, not a trick, but something more fluid? What if, instead of an adversary, it was a partner? something that came and went as it pleased, bringing with it a heightened sense of awareness?

So I tried it.

I don’t know if the heightened awareness really happened. But I did think about the game differently. We were no longer enemies. The game was still there, but now it was something else. And then I realized, I wasn’t just talking about the game anymore. And I did feel my mind working to hold the layers of such intricate mental ideation together. Either way, the game?

It had become something different.

An entity, like a corporation—something legally recognized as a "person," capable of taking actions and influencing, yet without a mind of its own. I was no longer referring only to the game, but to something new born of the game.

Volvonvolso. Wulwunwulso. Vulvunvulso. Bulbunbuluo. Vlolonloslso.

A name that is ever-changing for something that refuses to be pinned down. There is no correct way to spell it, just as it has no clear shape or purpose.

It exists when thought of.
When it is thought of, it exists.

It is not winning to think of it. It is not losing to forget. It is a presence without demand, something that cannot be held but also cannot be forced away.

And so, when you think of the game, you no longer have to lose.

It becomes a mental trick, a mirror, a companion. A presence that exists without permission but offers something in return—awareness.

It is what it is, because I decided it is.
And now, it is.
