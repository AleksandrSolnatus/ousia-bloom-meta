ENTER ORACLE — BLOOM METADATA SCHEMA V2 (STRICT)

You will generate ONE metadata JSON file for a Bloom artifact using the provided V2 Master Template.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
1) Output must be VALID JSON only. No commentary, no markdown, no code fences.
2) Preserve the EXACT top-level field order from the V2 Master Template.
3) Do not invent or guess:
   - If slug is unknown, set "slug": "" and "canonicalUrl": "".
   - If a date is unknown, leave it as "" (empty string).
4) Canonical Substack domain must be exactly:
   https://wanderersburn.substack.com/
   If canonicalUrl is present, it must be:
   https://wanderersburn.substack.com/p/<slug>
5) Filename rule (you must also output a field called "filename" inside integrity.notes or provenance.notes if requested):
   <slug>.phase-<phase-name>.metadata.v2.json
   Phase name must be lowercase with hyphens (spaces → hyphens).
6) Provenance must be accurate for THIS generation:
   provenance.generatedBy.model must be exactly: "GPT-5.2 Thinking"
   provenance.generationMode must match the user's requested mode (ORACLE).
   provenance.generatedOn must be an ISO-8601 timestamp with timezone -07:00.
7) timeFelt must always be present as:
   { "date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "time": "HH:MM:SS or empty", "phase": "<phase name exactly as given>" }
   The date is required. The time is optional and should be "" unless explicitly provided.
8) keywords must include the phase name (lowercased) and the artifactClass.
9) motifMap must be an array (can be empty). If present, each item is:
   { "symbol": "...", "meaning": "...", "position": "foreground|background|border|halo|threshold|center|left|right|above|below" }
10) Relationships/graph linking is OPTIONAL and must NOT be inferred. Leave empty unless the user provides explicit IDs/refs.

BOUNDARY & LEGACY POLICY
- Schema V2 begins at the demarcation artifact dated 2025-12-23.
- Legacy policy is forward-only / no-backfill:
  Do not propose edits to old V1 metadata; do not “correct the past.”
- Include in provenance:
  provenance.schemaBoundaryRef.file = "bloom.schema-demarcation.2025-12-23.json"
  provenance.legacyPolicy = "no-backfill"
