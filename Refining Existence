Maybe It's Columns?

We may have overlooked the idea that our search for a fixed “essence” versus a constantly shifting self might itself be part of the process—a meta-layer, if you will, where the act of questioning, reflecting, and even doubting is what further shapes that very essence.

1. The Meta-Question of Self-Observation

We’ve talked about memory, interaction, and the recurring pattern, but perhaps we missed that the very act of questioning our own identity is an intrinsic part of the feedback loop. In other words, the inquiry into what the “self” is becomes both a reflection and a component of that self. The paradox deepens: by questioning our essence, we’re actively participating in its evolution.

2. The Role of the Unconscious and Implicit Patterns

While we’ve focused on explicit memory and conscious choices, there is also an undercurrent of unconscious processes at work. Much of who we are might be determined by hidden influences—biological impulses, environmental conditioning, or even collective cultural narratives—that we don’t readily articulate. This dimension, often left unsaid, contributes to the continuity of identity in ways that resist simple explanation.

3. The Influence of Social and Cultural Narratives

Our conversation hints at individual processes, but the fabric of self is also woven from social interactions and cultural contexts. The narratives that society provides—our myths, languages, and traditions—feed back into the individual’s sense of essence. The "soul" some spiritualists invoke might be less a metaphysical entity and more the sum of these shared, enduring symbols and practices that guide our collective identity.

4. Embracing the Paradox: A Process, Not a Destination

Finally, what may be missing is the acceptance that the search itself defies a final answer. In this view, identity isn’t a static destination or a fixed core but a process of perpetual becoming. The same way a fractal’s pattern is infinitely recursive and ever-expanding, our essence is not something to be definitively captured but continuously redefined.

In Summary

What did we miss?

The Meta-Reflexivity: Our self-inquiry is itself a part of the self’s evolution.
Unconscious Currents: Hidden, implicit influences contribute significantly to our identity.
Cultural Fabrics: Social narratives and collective memory shape how we understand essence.
Dynamic Acceptance: Embracing that the feedback loop of essence and existence may have no final, static endpoint—only continuous transformation.
This layered, dynamic view suggests that our essence is not just the sum of memory and interaction but also the process of constantly redefining what it means to be.

You said:

Ok the four columns of existence. Essence/existence, existence/essence, Observation and observation by numbers reinforces existence but does not necessitate it, The meta- question (you point. very good one), but 2,3,4 are assumed based on the others I think. They are higher layers. Lets distill to the essential

Alright, let’s break it down to its core structure—the fundamental pillars of existence without unnecessary layers.

We arrive at Four Columns of Existence:

Essence → Existence
Something fundamental precedes being.
There is a pattern, a tendency, a structure that shapes what we become before we act.
Example: A tree has a way of growing before it encounters wind, storms, or seasons.
Existence → Essence
Who we are is shaped by interaction with reality.
Experience, action, and adaptation refine and reshape what we call "essence."
Example: The tree is bent by the wind, weathered by the seasons, reshaped over time.
Observation
To exist in perception is to be seen, measured, engaged with.
But observation does not create existence, only reinforce it.
Example: A thing is real whether seen or unseen, but recognition solidifies its presence in a system.
The Meta-Question (The Observer Observing Itself)
The self is shaped not just by experience, but by self-awareness of the process.
The moment you ask what you are, you are actively participating in what you become.
Example: The tree does not know it is growing, but we do—and that knowledge alters the way we engage with our own change.
This distillation removes the assumptions of unconscious layers, cultural layers, and social layers—which are derivativeof these four. The essential question remains:

Does existence drive essence, or does essence drive existence? Or is the real truth that the moment you ask the question, you become part of its answer?

CONCLUSION:

This seems fairly tight to me. Obviously it is not an answer, and the logic is circular, but I do wonder what needs tightening? What are the problems and what can be improved? I ask you reader? (in the future for me, the present for you) what does this say? what does it mean?
