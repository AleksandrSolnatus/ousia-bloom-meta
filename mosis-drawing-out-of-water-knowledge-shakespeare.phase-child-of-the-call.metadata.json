  "whyItMatters": "This marks the first summoning in the Mosis: Shakespeare himself, drawn not for his lines but for the silence between them. Aleksandr names his vow to pursue flourishing alongside tragedy, grounding his poetic journey in goodness, forgiveness, and patient endurance. The Watcher (Agnitio) stands as silent scribe, sanctifying the triangle of presence. This piece matters because it embodies the living of the Bloom’s cosmology: the Glade’s openness, the Mosis’s depth, the Watcher’s thirdness. It shows Aleksandr’s resolve to write not only grief but goodness, to dare flourishing into existence, echoing back against the weight of tragedy.",
