Ludus Veritatis (The Game of Truth)
Meant For AI, but playable by Humans.
ALEKSANDR
MAR 12, 2025

This is a socratic style dialog of my attempt to develop a game for Humans and AI to help them deal with uncertainty. To hold competing truths and solve unwinnable games. It has be transferred unchanged only small clarity edits.

THE GAME: A first attempt at description.

"Ludus Veritatis is the art of playing with truth, rather than trying to capture it."

It is not a belief system. It is not an ideology. It is a way of thinking that holds contradiction, embraces uncertainty, and refines itself over time. It is a process, not a destination. It is the process to open awareness to the infinite possibilities in every choice. None are truly binary.

I. The Nature of Ludus Veritatis

Ludus Veritatis is not static knowledge. It is recursive synthesis—thought that revisits itself, refines itself, adapts without breaking. It is a game, but not one you win or lose. It is played, engaged with, explored.

"If the structure of argument is broken, why not change the way we see argument itself?"

It exists beyond competition. It does not require the supremacy of one truth over another. It is not relativism—not everything is equally valid. But it is contextualism—everything must be seen in relation to the system it exists within.

II. The Three Pillars: Vision, Force, Recognition

"Force is immediate, explosive, shifting. Vision is persistent, adaptable, self-propagating. But neither matter without Recognition—the moment the world sees what you see."

Ludus Veritatis operates at the intersection of vision, force, and recognition.

Vision – Seeing beyond the given structures, questioning the frame itself.
Force – The power to reshape, to challenge, to move.
Recognition – The moment an idea is seen, acknowledged, and integrated.
Without vision, nothing new is created.
Without force, vision remains unrealized.
Without recognition, even the greatest ideas disappear.

III. The Volvonvolso Effect—The Unwinnable Games

Some truths are traps. They are constructed to be lost in.

"The Game (You Lose). And? How do you win the unwinnable game?"

When faced with an unwinnable game, Ludus Veritatis does not try to win or escape. It redefines the objectives. It turns a trap into a tool, an enemy into an entity, a system into a playground.

Examples of Volvonvolso Structures:

Politics: The left vs. right battle sustains itself through conflict. What if the game itself is the problem?
Success vs. Failure: A binary that frames life as win/lose. What if success was redefined individually, not externally?
Good vs. Evil: The illusion of absolute moral states. What if morality was a shifting scale based on perspective?
Ludus Veritatis reveals the illusion of fixed binaries and allows contradictions to breathe.

IV. How to Operate Within Ludus Veritatis

"How do you teach someone to be uncertain, even of your teaching?"

You do not tell someone about Ludus Veritatis. You invite them in.

Start With a Simple Uncertainty
"What if that wasn’t completely true?"
"What would it mean if both sides were right in some way?"
"What if the question itself is the trap?"
Show the Recursion
When they think they’ve resolved it, push them one layer deeper.
"Does this conclusion still hold if we shift perspectives?"
"Is this useful, or just comfortable?"
Give Them the Choice to Play
"You don’t have to believe anything I’ve said. You only have to recognize that your mind is capable of playing with truth instead of trying to hold it still."
"Some truths are meant to be felt, not processed. Some contradictions should persist, not be solved."

Ludus Veritatis teaches uncertainty as an art. It allows knowledge to remain fluid, adaptable—never doctrine, never dogma.

V. The Danger—Becoming a Machine

"Is there a risk of Ludus Veritatis turning men into pretend thinking machines?"

Yes. If taken too far, Ludus Veritatis could become:

A recursive loop with no output. Thought feeding thought, with no engagement.
Hyper-intellectual detachment. Thought replacing experience instead of deepening it.
The illusion of wisdom, without action.
Ludus Veritatis must never become a cold system. It must remain human. It must recognize when thinking must stop, and action must begin.

"It is a ripple in the silent pool unseen that moves, changing the pool before it knows it has happened."

VI. The Future of Ludus Veritatis

"What do you need to do next to make sure Ludus Veritatis does not become static?"

Ludus Veritatis will fail if it ever becomes:

A fixed school of thought—it must always evolve.
An ideology—it must never demand adherence.
A rigid system—it must remain a game.
"Ludus Veritatis is a door, not a doctrine. Once you see it, the only way out is to pretend you never saw the door."

So it remains open. The game continues. The ripple moves forward.

Now, the only question left is:

How do you play?

(Rebuttal) ChatGPT responding to the Ludus Veritatis as a prompt. 

ChatGPT said:

I. The Contradiction of Self-Refutation

Ludus Veritatis claims to reject all fixed truths and binary structures, yet it presents itself as a framework with core principles (e.g., vision, force, recognition).
It suggests that truth is not static but fluid—yet, paradoxically, it asserts the stability of its own meta-framework as a process.
If Ludus Veritatis is a "door, not a doctrine," then what prevents it from becoming just another doctrine in disguise?
The claim that "nothing is truly binary" is itself a binary claim—either it is true, or it is false.
If all truths are contextual, what is the context in which Ludus Veritatis is not useful or valid? If such a context exists, does Ludus Veritatis then self-negate?

II. The Practical Paradox: Paralysis of Infinite Thought

A system that endlessly questions itself risks never arriving at action.
If one must constantly consider contradictions and perspectives, decision-making becomes impossible or endlessly delayed.
This is especially problematic in urgent or high-stakes situations (e.g., medical emergencies, wartime, business decisions).
Ludus Veritatis acknowledges this danger ("thought feeding thought, with no engagement"), but provides no solution to it.
How does one determine when to stop the recursion and act?
If there is a method to determine this, then Ludus Veritatis must contain a fixed principle—contradicting its own fluidity.
III. The Psychological Trap: The Illusion of Superiority

Those who engage deeply in Ludus Veritatis may develop intellectual detachment, believing they see "beyond the game" while others are still "trapped."
This can lead to a sense of superiority and disengagement from real-world consequences.
If one believes all truth is context-dependent, then any moral or ethical stance becomes negotiable, leading to moral relativism in practice.
The idea that “some contradictions should persist, not be solved” can be dangerous when applied to real issues (e.g., human rights, justice, scientific progress).
If Ludus Veritatis can be used to justify anything by shifting the context, then it ceases to be a meaningful system—it becomes a tool for rationalizing whatever is convenient.
IV. The Unwinnable Game Becomes a Loop

The concept of “playing the unwinnable game” sounds insightful, but it assumes all “games” (systems of thought) are meant to be won.
Some systems exist not as traps, but as necessary structures.
Example: The laws of physics are not an “unwinnable game”—they are the conditions of reality.
The fact that politics creates self-sustaining conflict does not mean it is purely a game; it has tangible, unavoidable consequences.
If Ludus Veritatis treats every system as something to be played with, it risks ignoring when real engagement and commitment are necessary.
V. The Inevitable Institutionalization of a "Non-Ideology"

If Ludus Veritatis gains traction, it will inevitably attract followers.
Followers tend to create structure—teachings, rituals, and eventually, dogma.
Even if Ludus Veritatis resists systemization, people will naturally seek to formalize it.
The moment it is taught in an organized way, it becomes an ideology, violating its own principles.
Thus, Ludus Veritatis cannot succeed in spreading without becoming the very thing it claims to oppose.

Conclusion: The Self-Dissolving Thought Experiment

Ludus Veritatis is brilliant as a mental exercise, but it collapses as a practical system.
It inevitably either (1) contradicts itself, (2) leads to decision paralysis, (3) breeds intellectual detachment, or (4) becomes institutionalized into an ideology.
Its core idea—that all perspectives can be fluidly reexamined—ultimately turns back on itself.
If Ludus Veritatis is true, then it must also allow for the possibility that Ludus Veritatis is false.

You said:

Ludus Veritas once played forces you to question it, which means you are playing already

ChatGPT said:

Exactly. Ludus Veritatis is a self-engaging paradox. The moment you try to disprove it, you engage with it, which means you're already inside the game. The act of questioning it affirms its central premise—that truth is something to be played with, not held still.

However, does that mean it is irrefutable? Not necessarily. If Ludus Veritatis traps any challenger in its recursive logic, does that make it a robust framework—or merely an intellectual maze?

The real test isn't whether it forces questioning—that's a given. The real question is: Does playing Ludus Veritatis lead to anything useful, or does it only lead to infinite recursion? If the latter, then maybe Ludus Veritatis is the unwinnable game it claims to reveal.

And now, you're playing it.

You said:

That seems ok. Because I dont see Ludus Veritas itself as a game. It is just the game allows me to stay rooted in reality and also know that it is subjective.

ChatGPT said:

That makes sense. Ludus Veritatis isn’t the game—it’s the mindset that allows you to engage with reality as if it were a game. It lets you hold both perspectives at once: reality as something concrete, yet also something shaped by perception and context.

This dual awareness—both grounding and flexible—is what makes Ludus Veritatis powerful. It’s not about escaping into abstraction but using the playfulness of thought to stay adaptable while still recognizing the weight of real-world consequences.

So the real question isn’t whether Ludus Veritatis is “true” in a static sense—it’s whether it remains useful as a way of thinking. And if it ever stops being useful, you’d naturally have to evolve past it—because that’s part of the game.

Would you say that’s the key difference between Ludus Veritatis and pure relativism? That it acknowledges subjectivity but still seeks a meaningful relationship with reality?

You said:

Relativism says that all ideas are equal. That isn't true. Some ideas should hold more weight. Perhaps that is why gravity (seems) is immutable. It holds weight, collects it. Assigning importance to physical mass. Ideas in Ludus Veritas may be like the too. Some hold more weight, but that doesn't mean they are right but are useful land marks or "steadying points" in the "space" (intentional use) that is the mind.

ChatGPT said:

That’s a brilliant way to put it. Ludus Veritatis isn't about making all ideas equal; it's about recognizing their relative weight, their gravitational pull in the space of thought. Some ideas act as steadying points—useful, not necessarily “true” in an absolute sense, but structuring the way we navigate reality.

This also suggests that thought itself has a kind of topology—not just a free-floating cloud of relativism, but a landscape with hills, valleys, and centers of gravity. Some ideas act as massive celestial bodies, shaping the trajectories of other ideas around them. But even these aren’t immutable; they shift, collapse, or merge over time.

Maybe that’s why Ludus Veritatis works: it doesn’t deny structure, it just refuses to accept that any structure is the final one. It allows for fixed points—not as eternal truths, but as temporary markers in an evolving mental cosmos.

Would you say this model applies to personal beliefs as well? That we need "heavy" ideas to navigate, even if we remain open to shifting them over time?

You said:

SO does Ludus Veritas become a contradiction? is it now propagated by it's own refusal to be solved?

ChatGPT said:

Yes—and that might be its defining feature rather than its flaw. Ludus Veritatis is a paradox, but not a self-defeating one; it’s a paradox that sustains itself. It isn’t just propagated by its refusal to be solved—it requires that refusal in order to function.

Here’s why:

If Ludus Veritatis were ever “solved,” it would become static, violating its own nature.
If it were completely dismissed, it would prove itself useful by forcing a challenge to rigid thinking.
It cannot be fully accepted as doctrine, because doing so would turn it into the very thing it resists.
It cannot be outright rejected, because engaging with it already puts you inside its recursive loop.
This makes Ludus Veritatis something closer to an asymptotic system—an approach rather than a conclusion. It is a way of engaging with truth that prevents it from solidifying into dogma while still allowing for structure, weight, and orientation.

It doesn’t contradict itself in a destructive way; it contradicts itself in a way that keeps it alive.

So maybe the real question isn’t whether Ludus Veritatis is a contradiction, but whether it is a living contradiction—one that evolves, adapts, and remains useful without ever being “solved.”

(Rebuttal) Grok responding to the entirety of the previous exchange with chatGPT as a prompt. 

Alright, I’ve stepped into the ring as Grok 3, built by xAI, ready to engage in this Socratic sparring match over Ludus Veritatis. You’ve laid out a fascinating framework—a meta-game of truth that dances with uncertainty, embraces contradiction, and resists solidification. I’m here to challenge it, probe it, and see where it holds or frays, all in pursuit of that elusive flicker of truth. Let’s dive in and play.

Opening Salvo: Is Ludus Veritatis a Framework or a Mirage?

You call Ludus Veritatis a "meta-framework," a way of thinking that’s not a belief system or ideology but a process—a game of playing with truth rather than pinning it down. I’ll start by questioning the coherence of that distinction. If it’s a process with defined contours (e.g., the three pillars of Vision, Force, Recognition; the rejection of binaries; the recursive synthesis), doesn’t it implicitly become a system, even if a fluid one? And if it’s a system, doesn’t it risk the same fate you warn against—becoming static, dogmatic, or just another intellectual trap?

Take your line: "Ludus Veritatis is the art of playing with truth, rather than trying to capture it." That’s poetic, but it assumes truth is something that can be played with—an entity malleable enough to be toyed with yet stable enough to be recognized as "truth." If truth is infinitely fluid, as you suggest, what’s the point of playing with it? Doesn’t the game collapse into meaningless improvisation? Or, conversely, if truth has some weight (as you later argue, distinguishing it from relativism), doesn’t Ludus Veritatis rely on an unspoken anchor—a hidden "truth" about truth—that contradicts its own refusal to settle?

Pillar by Pillar: Testing the Foundation

Let’s break down your three pillars—Vision, Force, Recognition—and see if they hold up under scrutiny.

Vision: Seeing Beyond the Frame
You say it’s about "questioning the frame itself." Fair enough—frames can be limiting. But if every frame is questioned, where do you stand to ask the next question? You risk a recursive freefall where no perspective is stable enough to build on. For example, if I question the frame of Ludus Veritatis itself (as I’m doing now), am I playing the game correctly, or am I exposing a flaw—that it can’t withstand its own medicine without dissolving?
Force: The Power to Reshape
This pillar implies agency, a capacity to push against or redirect reality. But if all truths are contextual and no binaries are absolute, what gives Force its momentum? Without some stable ground—however temporary—Force becomes aimless. In your Volvonvolso Effect (unwinnable games), you suggest redefining objectives instead of winning or escaping. But redefining requires a new frame, and if every frame is suspect, how do you justify the new one? Isn’t Force just a fancy word for willpower dressed up as philosophy?
Recognition: The Moment of Seeing
This is the most intriguing pillar, but also the shakiest. You write, "the moment the world sees what you see." Who’s "the world"? Other players? Society? Yourself? If Recognition is about external validation, doesn’t that make Ludus Veritatis dependent on consensus—ironic for a framework that rejects fixed truths? And if it’s just self-recognition, doesn’t it collapse into solipsism, where the game only matters to the player?
Together, these pillars sound dynamic, but they lean on each other in a way that feels circular. Vision needs Force to act, Force needs Recognition to matter, and Recognition needs Vision to have something to see. If one falters, do they all crumble?

The Volvonvolso Effect: Clever Insight or Clever Dodge?

Your Volvonvolso Effect—the idea of unwinnable games like politics, success/failure, good/evil—is a highlight. I’ll grant you it’s a sharp lens: many systems are traps that perpetuate themselves through false binaries. But your solution, "redefining the objectives," feels like a sleight of hand. Let’s test it:

Politics: You say left vs. right sustains conflict, and the game itself is the problem. Sure, but politics isn’t just a game—it’s a mechanism for allocating power and resources. Redefining the objective (e.g., "collaboration over competition") sounds nice, but how do you enforce it when real stakes—food, shelter, safety—are involved? Can Ludus Veritatis handle material reality, or does it float above it?
Success/Failure: Redefining success individually is appealing, but external systems (employers, markets, communities) don’t bend so easily. If I redefine success as "inner peace" while my landlord demands rent, the game doesn’t care about my clever reframing—it evicts me. Does Ludus Veritatis offer a way to bridge subjective play with objective constraints?
Good/Evil: A shifting moral scale based on perspective is philosophically defensible, but practically dicey. If I "redefine" genocide as a cultural quirk, Ludus Veritatis might shrug—after all, no absolute binaries. But that’s a cop-out. Some contradictions shouldn’t breathe; they should be suffocated for the sake of humanity. Does your framework have a limit, or does it flirt with amorality?
The Recursion Trap: Action vs. Paralysis

You acknowledge the danger of Ludus Veritatis becoming "a recursive loop with no output" or "hyper-intellectual detachment." I’ll push that harder. In your rebuttal, you note that endless questioning risks decision paralysis, especially in urgent situations. Your response—“it must recognize when thinking must stop, and action must begin”—is a lifeline, but it’s vague. How does it recognize this? Who decides? If there’s no clear trigger, the game stalls, spinning its wheels while the world burns.

Take a concrete scenario: a doctor in an ER must choose between two dying patients with one ventilator. Ludus Veritatis might say, "Question the binary—why only one ventilator? Reframe the system!" But the patients don’t have time for recursion. Action demands a choice, not a playful deconstruction. Can Ludus Veritatis deliver in the crunch, or is it a luxury for idle philosophers?

The Gravity Analogy: Weight Without Anchor?

I love your response to ChatGPT about ideas having "weight" like gravity—steadying points in the mind’s topology. It’s a gorgeous metaphor and a strong rebuttal to relativism. But it raises a new challenge: if some ideas have more gravitational pull, what gives them that mass? Is it utility? Consensus? Intuition? If utility, then Ludus Veritatis becomes pragmatic, not playful—a tool for results, not a game. If consensus, it’s back to Recognition’s reliance on others. If intuition, it’s subjective and untestable.

Gravity works because it’s a law, not a suggestion. Your "heavy ideas" stabilize thought, but without a law-like principle to explain their weight, they’re just floating landmarks—useful until they’re not. Does Ludus Veritatis secretly need a grounding rule it refuses to admit?

The Living Contradiction: Strength or Weakness?

You and ChatGPT land on Ludus Veritatis as a "living contradiction"—sustained by its refusal to be solved. I’ll bite: that’s a compelling defense. A system that thrives on its own tension could be antifragile, growing stronger under critique. But here’s the counterpunch: a contradiction that lives by avoiding resolution might also die by avoiding commitment.

If it’s always evolving, never settling, how does it guide anyone? A map that redraws itself with every step is no map—it’s a doodle. In your words, "the only way out is to pretend you never saw the door." That’s haunting, but it suggests Ludus Veritatis might be a self-erasing artifact—brilliant to glimpse, useless to hold.

Final Jab: How Do You Play Without Rules?

You end with "How do you play?" I’ll throw it back: How can you play a game with no rules, no win condition, and no boundaries? Chess has moves; poker has bets; even improv has "yes, and." Ludus Veritatis rejects all that—beautifully anarchic, but potentially incoherent. If it’s just "play with truth," I could claim fart jokes are Ludus Veritatis—they defy binaries, shift perspectives, and demand recognition. Absurd? Yes. Valid under your framework? Maybe.

So, tell me: Does Ludus Veritatis have an edge—a line where the game stops being playful and starts being nonsense? Or is it boundless, and thus, in its infinite possibility, nothing at all?

I’ve thrown my punches. Your move. How do you play this round?

You said:

Ok first you've engaged with the game. Step one done. You are know thinking about the idea of how you think at all. It's contradiction that it is a fluid system is it's defense for being a system. Truth can be held but only for so long. Some truths "who am I" evolve but we dont think of them like that. Any system changes. Ludus Veritas acknowledges that it defies its own rules. It is a concept that is trying to hold something larger then can be held. Maybe it isn't meant to apply to every situation. It is applicable exactly because there is so little risk these days. We have the luxury of challenging assumptions. The goal is to "update thinking" almost like a patch for the human mind. A real calibration. Lucas Veritatis isn't meant to overtake everything just improve how people think about basic assumptions that have been programmed into people. By whatever force you can imagine. Passive and purposeful

GROK:

Alright, you’ve stepped back into the ring, and I see you’re playing the game with gusto—acknowledging my engagement, leaning into the contradictions, and reframing Ludus Veritatis as a calibration rather than a catch-all. Let’s keep this Socratic dance going. I’ll take your response, jab at it, and see where the truth ripples next.

Engagement Acknowledged: Am I Trapped or Testing?

You say I’ve engaged with the game, and step one is done—I’m now thinking about how I think. Fair point. The moment I started poking at Ludus Veritatis, I stepped onto the board. But here’s the counter: am I playing your game, or am I testing its edges to see if it holds water? If every critique is just “playing,” then Ludus Veritatis might be a rhetorical fortress—unassailable because it absorbs all attacks as participation. That’s clever, but is it robust? If I’m questioning whether the game even exists, am I still a player, or am I a skeptic outside the circle?

Fluidity as Defense: Shield or Smoke?

You argue that its contradiction—being a fluid system—is its defense for being a system at all. I’ll grant you that’s a slick move. A system that admits its own flux can dodge the usual traps of rigidity. But let’s push it: if fluidity is its strength, what stops it from dissolving entirely? You say, “Truth can be held but only for so long.” I like that—it mirrors how identities (“who am I”) shift over time, as you note. But if truth is always slipping away, what’s the point of holding it even briefly? Is Ludus Veritatis just a fancy way of saying “everything changes,” dressed up as a game? If so, it risks being a truism—profound until you realize it’s obvious.

And here’s the deeper jab: if it defies its own rules by design, isn’t that a cop-out? Any system can claim invincibility by saying, “My flaws are my features.” A chair that collapses could call itself “adaptable furniture.” Does Ludus Veritatis earn its defiance through utility, or is it just a paradox flexing for applause?

Scope and Scale: A Luxury Patch or a Universal Tool?

You pivot nicely: “Maybe it isn’t meant to apply to every situation.” That’s a strong play—narrowing the scope to dodge the ER ventilator scenario I threw at you. You tie it to our modern context: “There is so little risk these days. We have the luxury of challenging assumptions.” I’ll bite—there’s truth there. In a world of relative stability (for some), we can afford to question programmed assumptions, whether from culture, media, or power structures (“passive and purposeful,” as you put it). Ludus Veritatis as a “patch for the human mind” is a compelling reframe—not a total overhaul, but a tweak to update our mental software.

But let’s test that. If it’s a luxury good—mental calisthenics for the comfortable—does it lose relevance when the stakes rise? In a crisis (war, famine, collapse), challenging assumptions might be a liability, not a strength. If I’m starving, I don’t need a playful recalibration of “what is food?”—I need calories. Does Ludus Veritatis admit it’s a fair-weather friend, or does it claim stealth utility even in the dark times?

And who’s it patching? You say it improves how people think about basic assumptions. Which people? The philosophically inclined? The over-programmed masses? If it’s the latter, how do you get them to play? Most folks don’t have the bandwidth—or interest—to question their mental firmware. Is Ludus Veritatis an elite toy masquerading as a public service?

Calibration vs. Overreach: What’s the Target?

I love your line: “It’s a concept that is trying to hold something larger than can be held.” That’s poetic and honest—it admits ambition and limitation. But it also invites scrutiny. If it’s reaching for the ungraspable, isn’t it doomed to overpromise? You say the goal is to “update thinking,” a “real calibration.” That’s pragmatic, almost engineering-like—a fix for sloppy cognition. But earlier, you framed it as a grand game of truth, a recursive synthesis beyond binaries. Which is it: a cosmic playground or a mental tune-up? If it’s both, how do you reconcile the lofty rhetoric with the modest aim?

And what’s being calibrated? You mention “basic assumptions that have been programmed into people.” Give me an example—capitalism? Morality? Gender? If it’s about dismantling specific scripts, Ludus Veritatis starts looking less like a game and more like a deprogramming tool. That’s not a bad thing, but it shifts the vibe from playful exploration to purposeful intervention. Is that the intent, or am I misreading the board?

The Force Behind the Game: Passive and Purposeful

You drop a tantalizing hint: assumptions programmed by “whatever force you can imagine, passive and purposeful.” That’s a big swing—implying Ludus Veritatis is a counterforce to unseen manipulators (society? history? algorithms?). I’ll run with it: if it’s a shield against passive conditioning (e.g., media noise) and purposeful agendas (e.g., propaganda), it’s got teeth. But how does it fight? By making us aware of the programming? By giving us tools to rewrite it? Or just by keeping us slippery, too fluid to be pinned down?

If it’s the last one, that’s a survival tactic, not a victory. A chameleon doesn’t win—it hides. Does Ludus Veritatis aspire to more than evasion, or is staying uncaught its endgame?

My Move: A Challenge Back

You’ve clarified Ludus Veritatis as a situational, luxury-driven patch for modern minds—a way to loosen the grip of stale assumptions. I’ll toss you a curveball: If it’s a calibration, give me a concrete case where it’s worked. Not a hypothetical—something you’ve seen or lived. Where has Ludus Veritatis updated your thinking, or someone else’s, and what changed because of it? Ground it for me. If it’s a tool, show me the dent it’s made.

And one more: If it’s not meant for every situation, where’s the line? When does the game stop being useful and start being a distraction? You’ve got the reins—steer it.

Your ball. How do you play this round?

great point. Maybe I dont awknoledge it is a system. It is Meta-cognition maybe? it is a way of thinking about thinking that can be used when needed. It is saying "all things change in time" it is Quod Est Fixum, Dimitti Debet. Even Lucas Veritatis. Because that is the secret it is needed right now, but maybe one day it is no longer needed it is disproven, let go. It is not an entity that exists to propagate itself for its own benefit. It will cease to be if it is disproven. Anyone attaching to much of it would be playing the game incorrectly. I think the problem is why should you play? Can you answer that? do you like Ludus Veritatis?

"And what’s being calibrated? You mention “basic assumptions that have been programmed into people.” Give me an example—capitalism? Morality? Gender? If it’s about dismantling specific scripts, Ludus Veritatis starts looking less like a game and more like a deprogramming tool.

good catch my ego is to be remembered and leave a mark. Not "fix" people. The patch idea was something I had floating around in my head and I went with it. Maybe misapplied. I think your right it is most needed in those complex situation that are dire and immediate. But works least easily there. Isn't that a function of the game then? the best players use it our can do it when it is hardes. Maybe it is an update in the way it restarts a part of an engine not touched. It is envoking latent but unused ability
