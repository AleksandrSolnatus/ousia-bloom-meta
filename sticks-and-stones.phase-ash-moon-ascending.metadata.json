  "whyItMatters": "This story underscores the weight of words. It reframes the childhood rhyme 'sticks and stones may break my bones' into a deeper truth: that words wound as much as they heal, carrying the power to define a life. By healing, by reclaiming blessing, the protagonist shows that mastery of one\u2019s words restores not just speech but light itself.",
