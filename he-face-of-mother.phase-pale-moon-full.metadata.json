  "description": "A humble parable of acceptance and adaptation. A familyâ€™s bed begins to squeak, and though the sound persists, peace is found not by fixing it but by learning to rest anyway. The story embodies the light of ordinary grace â€” that serenity comes not from control, but from quiet endurance. It belongs to the phase of The Candleâ€™s Glow, where faith is practiced through gentle acceptance of imperfection.",
