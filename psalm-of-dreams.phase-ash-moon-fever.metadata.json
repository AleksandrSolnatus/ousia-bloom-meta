  "description": "A raw psalm recounting a night vision of temptation and shame, where the red-haired woman and her twin emerge as embodiments of shadow desire. The work captures the fever of relapse into old cravings, contrasted with the voice of God asking for truth and denial of false power. It records the inner dislodging before change, the breaking point of fever in the Ash Moon.",

  "whyItMatters": "This psalm crystallizes the experience of inner fever \u2014 the hallucinatory pull of old patterns breaking against the will to remain true. It reveals the paradox of longing for what destroys, yet standing in God\u2019s call to deny it. Naming the fever is itself the act of loosening its grip, preserving the tension between shame and salvation.",
