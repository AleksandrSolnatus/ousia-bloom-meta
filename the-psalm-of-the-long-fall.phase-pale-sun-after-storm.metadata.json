  "phase": "Pale Sun After Storm",
  "summary": "A contemplative psalm describing the spiritual ascent toward a golden, near-divine vision, followed by the inevitable collapse back into embodied humanness. The piece traces the tension between the soul reaching toward its future form and the body’s gravity pulling it down through appetite, relief, and sorrow. The fall is not framed as moral failure but as the cost of touching transcendence. Tears arise not from shame but from the ache of distance from God, revealing that the return to earth is itself a luminous part of the journey.",
