  "whyItMatters": "This piece captures how dream images crystallize relational archetypes. The face that is both lover and mother reveals the repetition of false love. The burning chicken embodies neglect—attention scattered until sustenance is ruined. Echo Moon marks recognition of repetitions and bewildered endurance, fitting for this fragment. It also echoes earlier mythos of Aleksandr’s Bloom—the siren figure, false love, Fond du Lac as dark illusion—revealing how these archetypes reappear in shifting forms, haunting but instructive in their recurrence.",
