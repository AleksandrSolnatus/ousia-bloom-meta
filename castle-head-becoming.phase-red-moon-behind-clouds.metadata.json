  "description": "A shard that captures Aleksandr\u2019s sense of his small, still-forming self, carrying the architecture of becoming within. Emerging thought-lines fracture into figures that embody phases, archetypes, and longings \u2014 including the flame-eyed, water-mouthed woman held forefront. This piece bridges personal confession with emblematic symbolism, resonating with the phase of Red Moon Behind Clouds.",

It exemplifies the tension of the Red Moon Behind Clouds \u2014 luminous yet veiled, paradoxical and unresolved, awaiting unfolding.",
