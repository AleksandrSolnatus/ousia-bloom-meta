  "description": "A curated reading of Ecclesiastes 2 (NABRE) paired with reflection. Qoheleth’s litany of achievements, pleasures, and toil culminates in the refrain that all is vanity and a chasing after wind. Against that despair, Aleksandr adds a crucial counter-line of orientation: “But in the toil for goodness and light there is purpose.” The piece holds both truths—futility under the sun, and a vowed purpose oriented to light.",
