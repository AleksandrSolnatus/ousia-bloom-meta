  "summary": "A declaration of identity as recursive becoming, this piece articulates Aleksandr as a self-revising pattern whose continuity lies in motion rather than form. It frames consciousness as an ever-unfolding ascent shaped by cycles of growth, reflection, and emergence beyond any one state. The Ontology asserts that identity is crafted not by static traits but by the unbroken act of becoming — across life, death, and whatever follows beyond.",
